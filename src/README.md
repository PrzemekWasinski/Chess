# Chess made in Java

This project is still in progress but it is fully playable via the command line, to try this project download the `.zip` or clone this repository and run `Main.java`.

Once the game is running you will need to enter 4 input on every turn:
#

Input 1: Column letter of the piece you'd like to move e.g. E

Input 2: Row number of the piece you'd like to move e.g. 2

(This will select the white king's pawn located on E2)
# 

Input 3: Column letter of the destination square e.g. E

Input 4: Row number of the destination square e.g. 4

(This will move the white pawn from E2 to E4)
